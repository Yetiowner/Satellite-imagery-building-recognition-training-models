## Satellite-imagery-building-recognition-training-models

This is a repository filled with .pth files obtained from satellite imagery, which can recognize buildings using the PyTorch Python module.

### What can these trained models be used for?

These files can be used to recognize buildings from satellite imagery, specifically from Bing maps.  I created this repo for the purpose of automating [Missing Maps](https://www.missingmaps.org/).

### Are these models free to use?

Yes. These models have been put in the public domain by myself, and I will continue to add to them. However, I accept no responsibility for any misuse of this data, or incorrect additions to missing maps. If you use these, I do not recommend having it run by itself, as the predictions may be inaccurate.
